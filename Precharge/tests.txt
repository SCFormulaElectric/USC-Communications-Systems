Tested using Precharge_Fault (PA5) pin connected to waveform generator. Do not have dc dc converter so we have to test our code using exposed pins.
Applied various frequencies, used gdb to print RESULTS: 

Why uint8_t prints this:
(gdb) print is_initialized 
$1 = 0 '\000'

BUGS: 
If frequency is disconnected (e.g. 0V on HV), then diff is never cleared. So frequency = 500_000 / diff; never changes. Defaults to 41?
Need to check this bug
