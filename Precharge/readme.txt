We're faced with a few constraints.
    - No UART
    - No status LED
    - No reset button

In order to bring up the board without having the 12v-12v converter or manual testing,
we have to use GDB.

We're using the CubeProgrammer CLI to flash, openocd, and arm-none-eabi-gdb.
We also use files from these repos:
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/develop/Device/ARM/ARMCM1/Include
https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis-device-c0/blob/main/Source/Templates/system_stm32c0xx.c

[STM discontinued the linkerscripts for gcc across their devices so
our linker script was generated by using the .icf linker scripts used in the IAR toolchain and Gemini to 
write the gcc equivalents. ]

We configured the dir as follows:
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   ├── stm32c011xx.h
│   ├── stm32c0xx.h
│   └── system_stm32c0xx.h
├── linker
│   └── STM32C011F6P6_FLASH.ld
├── readme.txt
├── src
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── system_stm32c0xx.c
└── startup
    └── startup_stm32c011xx.s

So far, we verified our tool chain, gdb, and that the clock runs at 48MHz (w/ 1 flash latency wait state).
We're working on reading a frequnecy on PA5 and inspecting the calculated frequency and time that it reached that frequency.

Also,
    need to update CMAKelists to include the alias in make flash
    Need to create a gdb script
