Pretty good progress so far
Chris: Working DMA, testing UART
Selena: Lots of heavy algorithms & can packet formatting completed

Need to integrate selena's code into main
There's lots, so it's best to go step by step.
Also should gradually test functionality of board.

Last week we failed to do UART. I don't think we grounded the two boards together.
Then, we should ground the mux voltage sensors and see if the ADC is working.
Then iterate through each to verify inttobinary is working.

we could also verify can bus, but this is a big set up so maybe when there's less traffic.

1 issue is Selena's code is polling based, and main uses DMA.
So, probably best to add functions to main and then redo the glue logic (i can do this)
When adding functions to main, please write a function prototype in the beginning then paste the function body near the end.
    see setMux function as an example.
